So idea is plants that can mutate into other plants, depending on there sroundings (biome, blocks, other plants)
    some plants drop useful stuff (redstone iron quaz, what ever)
    the "higher teir plants" don't drop a net positve on seeds so you have to keep mutating the lower teirs up to the high ones
